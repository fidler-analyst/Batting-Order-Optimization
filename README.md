# Batting-Order-Optimization
# The objective of this project is to produce an optimized batting order for a baseball team based off the individual player success in their numbered plate appearance.
# Some players are more productive in their first appearance than the third, and so on. The idea is that by aligning players with their respective appearance performances,
# you will cluster their hits and produce more runs.
